    # CiscoCommandConfig resource for Chef.
    # This resource allows raw configurations to be managed by chef.
    # It serves as a stopgap until specialized resources are created.
    #
    # It has the following limitations:
    # * The input message buffer is limited to 500KB
    # * Order is important. Some dependent commands may fail if their associated
    #   `feature` configuration is not enabled first
    # * Indentation counts! It implies sub-mode configuration. Use the switch's
    #   running-config as a guide and do not indent configurations that are not
    #   normally indented. Do not use tabs to indent.
    # * Inline comments must be prefixed by ! or #
    # * Negating a submode will also remove configuratons under that submode,
    #   without having to specify every submode config statement:
    #   `no router ospf RED` removes all configuration under router ospf RED
    # * Syntax does not auto-complete: use `Ethernet1/1`, not `Eth1/1`
    # * If a CLI command is rejected during configuration, the resource will
    #   abort at that point and will not continue to issue any remaining CLI.
    #   For this reason it is recommended to limit the scope of each instance
    #   of this resource.
