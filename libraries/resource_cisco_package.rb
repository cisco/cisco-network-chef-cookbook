    # CiscoPackage is essentially just a wrapper for yum to facilitate package
    # handling from Nexus Guestshell that is targeted for the host:
    #
    #  o Nexus Native bash shell:
    #     If chef-client runs from here then standard yum methods are invoked
    #     directly to handle the package operations. The preference is to use
    #     either "package" or "yum_package" for this environment.
    #
    #  o Nexus Guestshell:
    #     If chef-client runs from here then package operations are handled via
    #     Nexus NXAPI and target the host environment rather than the Guestshell
    #     itself. Use either "package" or "yum_package" for local package
    #     handling within Guestshell.
